## First Kanisorn Sutham
Hello, I'm First (my nickname) and the rest of that is my full name - a developer at [ThoughtWorks Thailand](https://thoughtworks.com). In my spare time I practice software engineering technique via my pet project _(normally it is about 1~ hours in the morning before the work)_. I'm trying to turn my pet project to open source somedays 🚀 . I live in Bangkok, Thailand.
